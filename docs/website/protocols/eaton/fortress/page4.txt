=== 300 Starting Two-way RS232 Communication +

You can set up two-way (full-duplex) communication with the Fortress using a dumb
terminal or terminal communication program. Two-way communication
allows you to issue commands to the Fortress and to display
information on your computer or terminal's screen. The commands are
in Section 400. To set up two-way communication, follow these
steps: +

* Order an interface cable from Best Power (or call Best Power for
cable specifications). Connect this cable to the UPS and to the
terminal. (Instead of a terminal, you can use a computer with
terminal emulation software such as CROSSTALK' or Procomm-, or the
Windows Terminal function.) If you are using a terminal, note that
Fortress supports the Televideo 900 series, ADM3A and WSE 50
emulation.

.Note:
[NOTE]
=================
If you are connecting the Fortress to a modem, you must
configure the modem properly. Set +
up the modem to ignore RTS and CTS signals (disable hardware
handshaking). Enable sup +
port for X/ON X/OFF software handshaking. At the Fortress, parameters
73 and 74 enable +
software handshaking; unless you have changed the settings of these
parameters, Fortress is +
already set up for software handshaking.
==================

* Start the terminal or run terminal emulation software on your
computer. 
* Set the ten-ninal or terminal emulation software for the
following:
* Set the ten-ninal or terminal emulation software for the following: • FULL DUPLEX • 1200 baud (see note in step 4) • 8 data bits and 1 stop bit • No parity
* Press <ENTER> at your keyboard. You should receive a => prompt. Press <ENTER> a few times to make sure the Fortress responds.
.Note:
[NOTE]
====================
If you want to change the baud rate at which the Fortress communicates, follow these steps:
====================
.... Set your
computer or terminal baud rate to 1200 temporarily so you can
communicate with the Fortress. +
.... Find the DIP switches on the back of the Fortress; then, find
DIP switch 1. +
image:images/gr000004.png["dip switch detail"]
.... If DIP switch I is
set to the right, the Fortress baud rate will stay 1200 until you
change the DIP switch setting. If DIP switch I is set to the left
as it is in the drawing, the Fortress baud rate depends on the
setting of parameter 70. When the Fortress is shipped, parameter
70 is also set to 1200. To change the DIP switch setting, use a
*nonmetal* object such as a toothpick to move DIP switch I
from one side to the other; if the UPS is on, it will beep.
*Make sure you do not accidentally change the position of
another DIP switch. +
.... Establish communication with the Fortress. Then, enter the
Service password by typing *password 2639*<ENTER>. +
.... To display baud rate (parameter 70), type *display 70*
<ENTER>. If you have never changed the parameter
setting, the display will show "70 Baud 2)1200." Setting 0 300, 1
= 600, and 2 = 1200. +
.... To change the setting type *program 70 <new setting>*
<ENTER>. Example: To change the baud rate to 300, type
*program 70 0* <ENTER>. +
.... Clear the password by typing clearpassword <ENTER>. 




* To control or monitor
the Fortress, simply type the command you need and press
<ENTER>. (See Section 402 for a list of commands.) You can use
the following keystrokes as you type commands or view
displays:
