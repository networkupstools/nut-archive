=== Query the status of UPS



Command from PC to UPS

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command (1 byte)					|		

CSUM 						
		|		

'Q'					|		

'1' (ASCII)					|		

XX			
|=============== 






CSUM 		=	2's complement of the SUM of the total
package

=== UPS Status Feedback / Shutdown Request



Command from UPS to PC

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command (1 byte)					|		

CSUM 						
		|		'Q'					|	'A' - AC Fail		 +
'B' - Battery Low 		 +
'C' - Both A & B		 +
'D' - All normal		 +
'E' - System Shutdown Request					|	XX		 +
QE - UPS requests for System 		 +
Shutdown. PC to read three consecutive QE bytes and 		acknowledge before proceeding with normal shutdown.

=== System & UPS Shutdown



Step 1. Command from PC to UPS

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command (1 byte Integer)					|		

CSUM 						
		|		

'T'					|		

XX (1 ~ 255)					|		

YY			
|=============== 



(T - stands for Time-delay, XX is the delay factor in
multiple of 10 seconds. So, max. delay time = 42:30 min.)





Step 2. Command from UPS to PC

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command 								|		

CSUM (same as MCOL checksum)			
		|		

'T'					|		

'A'					|		

XX			
|=============== 



(TA - stands for Time-delay command acknowledged)


Step 3. Command from PC to UPS 

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command (1 byte)					|		

CSUM 						
		|		

'S'					|		

'D'					|		

XX			
|=============== 



(SD - stands for shutdown)





Step 4. Command from UPS to PC

[options="header,autowidth",frame="all", grid="all",cols="<,<,<"]
|=============
		|		

Header (1 byte)					|		

Command (1 byte)					|		

CSUM 						
		|		

'S'					|		

'A' 								|		

XX			
|=============== 




(SA - stands for shutdown acknowledged)




=== Miscelleaneous



*	Software to poll the UPS at least 6 times in 2 seconds at
program startup to determine if there is "NO COMMUNICATION"
and advise "Please check cable connection", etc.

*	During normal operation, if software receives five checksum
error, display "Communication Error".

*	If there is no response from the UPS, display "No
Communication" (after 5 consecutive times) in RED colour (must
be outstanding) .

*	PC to send a UPS shutdown delay "TXX" and continue
sending command until it receives a confirmation command "TA"
before sending ups shutdown command "SD". TXX - where XX
is a multiple of 10 seconds. So, maximum time delay is 42 minutes
and 30 seconds (255 * 10 = 2550 seconds).

*	Software to have a UPS Off Delay setting screen to
accommodate item d. above.

*	PC must send a 'SD' continuously until it receives a 'SA'
from the UPS before system can perform shutdown.

*	Baudrate = 1200 bps.

*	Software to perform system shutdown when it receives three
consecutive system shutdown request bytes ('QE') from UPS. A pop-up
message with 5 seconds countdown, and message 'System powering down,
shutdown in 5 seconds' is to be displayed. The usual system shutdown
(with autosaving of files) will take place (to include item d. &
f. above).
