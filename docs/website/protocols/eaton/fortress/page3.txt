=== 200 Choosing a Communication Mode +

Fortress has two communication modes: RS232 Communication Mode and Extended Signal Mode. This section explains the modes and how to change them. +

=== 201 RS232 Communication Mode +

Fortress is set to the RS232 Communication Mode when you receive
it. This is the mode that your CheckUPS II Suite uses; it is also the
mode that you must use for RS232 communication. When you select this
mode, the pins at the DB9 port perform these functions: +

|=============
|Pin	|Function
|1	|RS232 Receive Data. Receives incoming RS232 communication data.
|2	|RS232 Transmit Data. Sends outgoing RS232 communication data.
|3	|Normally open On Battery Cntact. A normally open contact that closes 15 seconds after the UPS switches to battery power. You can adjust the delay before the contact closuses, and you can change the contact to normally closed; see Section 504.
|4	|Common. The signal ground for all signal pins.
|5	|Normally Open Low Battery Contact. A normally open contact that closes during a Low Battery, Near Low Battery or Low Runtime alarm. This tells CheckUPS II and other shutdown software when to start a computer shutdown. __You can program this contact to close during other alarms; see Section 503.__ You can also change ther contact to normally closed; see Section 504.
|6	|Plug and Play Sense for Windows 95
|7	|Remote Shutdown. Shorting this pin to common turns the UPS off. See Section 505 to change what causes a shutdown and the delay before the shutdown.
|8	|Unregulated +12V isolated source.
|9	|Not Used.
|=============== 

Contacts consist of open
collector circuits capable of switching up to +40 VDC 50 mA resistive
load. Only pins I and 2 differ from Extended Signal Mode; these are
the pins that allow RS232 communication.



=== 202 Extended Signal Mode +

The Extended Signal Mode does not allow RS232 communication, but
it includes a programmable contact for remote shutdown and a pin that
produces a 12 VDC (RS232-level) signal when the unit runs on battery.
This mode is mainly for applications that require signals for your
computer software or other external equipment. + 
Only pins I and 2 change in this mode; pins 3-9 have the same
functions that they have in the RS232 Communication Mode. See the
table on the next page. +

=== 203 Selecting the Communication Mode +

DIP switch 4 on the back of your Fortress sets the communication
mode. The DIP switches are on the right side of the back panel as
shown below. +

To set the
communication mode, find DIP switch 4 shown. Use a *nonmetal*
object such as a toothpick to move the DIP switch to the correct
position for the communication mode you select (left for RS232 Mode,
right for Extended Signal Mode). If the UPS is on, it will beep when
you change the communication mode. *Make sure you do not
accidentally change the position of another DIP switch.* +
