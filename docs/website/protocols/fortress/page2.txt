== 100 How You Can Use the Communication Port

You can use the Fortress' RS232 communication port for several functions: +
*12 Level -- Pin 8:* +

You can use the + 12 VDC Level on pin 8 for setting an external
logic level 1. You can use this to set
a fixed input logic level in an external device. The voltage is
present whenever the Fortress is operating. +



=== CheckUPS II Software:


If you are using the free CheckUPS II software you received for
power monitoring and automatic
shutdown, the communication port is the connection point for your
CheckUPS II interface cable.
See the instructions that came with the CheckUPS II software.
CheckUPS II is also set up to work
with Windows 959 Plug and Play Sense. See step 8 in the Startup
section of the Fortress User
Guide.



=== Remote Monitoring (Relay Contacts):
Fortress has contacts that indicate when the unit is running on
battery and when it is sounding a Low Battery Alarm. You can connect
these contacts to your own alarm system or indicator for remote
monitoring. ChcckUPS II software also uses these contacts to control
the shutdown of computers or computer networks. +



Using parameter 8 1, you can decide which alarms will activate alarm
contact; see Section 503 for more information. Using parameters 80
and 88-89, you can also change the contacts from normally open to
normally closed, and you can change the delay before the battery
contact closes. See Section 504 for more information. +



=== Remote Shutdown: 

Two pins at the Fortress' DB9S port allow you to shut down your
Fortress from a remote switch.
Parameters 85-87 and 82-84 let you decide what type of signal or
contact action will cause a shut
down and how long the Fortress should delay before shutdown. See
Section 505 for more information.



=== RS232 Communication:

You can connect your Fortress to a terminal, computer, or modem
for full-duplex communication. This connection lets you send commands
to the Fortress to display values or control Fortress operation. You
can even set up your Fortress to start and shut down automatically at
the times you choose. Section 300 describes how to to set up RS232
communication, Section 400 explains how to use Fortress commands, and
Section 500 explains how to use parameters. +
