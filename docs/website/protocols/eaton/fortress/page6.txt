== 500 Using Parameters +

=== 501 Parameter Table +

The table on the next few pages shows the parameters that you can view or program
from a terminal or computer. Some of these parameters keep track of
information (like Time or Date) or display operating and power
conditions (like voltage, current, or temperature). Other parameters,
(Like User ID) let you program the Fortress for special operating
conditions. +

When you use the Fortress commands to display and program parameters,
you can identify the parameter with either its number or name. If you
use the name, you can enter the whole parameter name or just the
letters in the short form. (See the Name column in the parameter
table). +

Passwords restrict access to some parameters; see the "Password to
Change" column in the table and Section 40 1. +

=== 502 Automatic Startup and Shutdown (Parameters 90-93) +

If you do not want the Fortress to run constantly, you can program it to startup
and shut down automatically using parameters 0, II, and 90-93. Just
follow the steps below. +

. You must enter the Service password before you can change
parameters 90-93. To enter the password, use the command *pw
2639*. +
. Using the *display* command, display parameters 0 and 11 to
make sure the time and the day of the week are correct. (Note that
parameter 0 shows the time in 24-hour or military time.) If both
parameters are correct, go to step 2. If not, follow steps a-b: +

.. Use this
command to change the time: *program time <new time>.* Be sure to use the 24-hour system. For example, if the time is
9:30 a.m., use the command *program time 09:30.* If the time
is 7:00 p.m., use the command *program time 19:00.* +
.. To change the day of the week, use this command: *program
day <new day of week>.* For the new day of the week, 0 =
Sunday, I = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, 3 = Wednesday, 4 = Thursday, 5 =
Friday, and 6 = Saturday. For example, if the day of the week is
Monday, use the command *program day 1.*

. Parameters 90-93 let you set up automatic startup and
shutdown. +
. Parameter 91 (ontiniedays or ontd) lets you choose which days you
want the Fortress to automatically shut down. When you receive the
Fortress, this is set to 0, which means none of the days have been
selected. +

If you want the Fortress to start automatically every day, use this
command: *program ontd 127.* If you only want Fortress to
operate some days, use the table below. In the right column enter "0"
for each day you do not want the Fortress to operate. For the days
you do want the Fortress to operate, enter the day's value from the
second column. Then, add the right column and use this command to
change the parameter setting: *program ontd <total of right
column>.* +

image:images/gr000028.png["day of week table"] +

__Example: __If you wanted the Fortress to operate
automatically Monday through Friday, you would write "0" next to
Sunday and Saturday and the values next to the other day. 0 + 2 + 4 +
8 + 16 + 32 + 0 = 62, so you would use the command *program ontd
62.*

. Parameter 90
(powerontime or ont) sets the time you want the Fortress to start
automatically. When you receive the Fortress, this parameter is set
to 8:00 a.m. If you want the Fortress to start at a different time,
use this command: *program ont <new start time>.* Be sure
to use 24-hour or military time. For example, if you want the
Fortress to start at 9:00 a.m., use the command *program ont 09:00.*
If you want the Fortress to start at 3:00 p.m., use the command
*program ont 15:00.*
. Parameter 92 (powerofftime or offt) sets the time you want the
Fortress to shut down automatically. When you receive the Fortress,
this parameter is set to 17: 00, which is 5: 00 p.m. If you want the
Fortress to shut down at a different time, use this command:
*program offt <new shutdown time>.* Be sure to use 24-hour
or military time. +
. Parameter 93 (offtimedays or oftd) lets you choose which days you
want the Fortress to shut down. When you receive the Fortress, this
is set to 0, which means none of the days have been selected. If you
want the Fortress to shut down automatically every day, use this
command: *program oftd 255.* +
If you only want Fortress to shut down some days, use the table
on page 29 to calculate the setting just as you did for parameter 9 1. __If you want the Fortress to start and shut down on the same
days, you can use the setting you calculatedfor parameter 91.__
. Clear the Service password using the clearpassword
command.

=== 503 Choosing Which Alarms Enable the Alarm Contact (Parameter 81) +

When you receive the Fortress, the alann contact (pin 5) only closes for the Low
Battery, Near Low Battery, and Low Runtime alarms. __This setting is
important ifyou are using yourfree CheckUPS II Suite software
pack-age or other automatic shutdown software.__ However, if you
are not using CheckUPS and you would like other alarms to close the
contact, you can use parameter 81 to determine which alarms will
close the contact. (See Section 504 for information about other
settings that affect the alarm contact.) +

__No matter how you program parameter 81,when the UPS is off, the alarm contact will be open.__ +

To program parameter 8 1, follow these steps: +

1. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. +
2. Display parameter 81 using the *display 81* command. +
3. The table on the next page will help you calculate the new
parameter settmig based on the alarms that you want to activate the
contact. If you do not want any of the alarms to activate the
contact, write "0" for the total. If you want some of the alarms to
activate the contact, see the table to find the Alarm Value for each
of these alarms; write the value for these alarms in the third column
of the table. Write "0" for alarms that should not activate the
contacts. Then, add the numbers in the third column. For example, to
enable alarms A (Low Battery), B (Near Low Battery), and C (High
Battery),write "I" for alarm A, "2" for alarm B, "4" for alarm C, and
"0" for the rest of the alarms. Ile total is 7. +

__If you are using the Fortress with an AS/400, you should ONLY
enable the alarm contact for the Low Battery, Near Low Battery, and
Low Runtime alarms. In the blanks, A = 1, B = 2, D=8, and C and E- K
= 0. The total = 11.__ +


image:images/gr000029.png["alarm table"] +


4. Now, change the parameter 81 setting to the total you found in step 3. To do this,
use the *program 81 <new setting>* command. +
__Example:__ If you would like to activate the contact for alarms
A, B, and C and your total in step 3 was 7, enter the command
*program 81 7*. +
5. Use the *display 81* command to display the parameter once
more and confirm that you have entered the correct setting. +
6. Clear the Service password using the *clearpassword* or
*cp* command. +



=== 504 Changing the Settings for Alarm and Battery Contacts (Parameters 80 and 88-89) +

Parameters 80 and 88-89 let you program how the alarm and battery contacts operate. +


==== Alarm Contact (Pin 5) +

When you receive the Fortress, a Low Battery Alarm will cause the
normally open contact on pin 5 to close to common (pin 4). (Section
503 tells you how to activate the contact for other alarms.) The
contact is normally open because parameter 80 is set to 0)Neg when
you receive the Fortress. If you would like the contact to be
normally closed and to open during the alarm, you must change
parameter 80 to 1)Pos. __No matter how you program parameter 80,
when the UPS is off, the alarm contact will be open.__ To change the parameter, follow these
steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. +
. Program parameter 80 to 1)Pos using this command: *program 81 1*. +
. Clear the password using the *clearpassword* or *cp* command. +

==== On Battery Contact(Pin 3) +

When you receive the Fortress, the on battery contact (pin 3) is
a normally open contact that closes 15 seconds after the Fortress
starts running on battery power. Using parameter 88, you can change
the contact to a normally closed contact. Using parameter 89, you can
adjust the 15-second delay. +

Parameter 88 is set to 0)Neg when you receive the UPS. This means
that the contact is normally open and that it closes when the
Fortress runs on battery power. To change the contact to a normally
closed contact that opens when the Fortress runs on battery, follow
these steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. +
. Program parameter 88 to 1)Pos using this command: *program 88 1*. __No matter how you program parameter 88, when the UPS is off, the inverter contact will be open.__ +
. Clear the password using the *clearpassword* or *cp* command.

After the Fortress begins running on battery power, parameter 89
determines how long the Fortress will wait before closing the on
battery contact. When you receive the Fortress, this parameter is set
to 15 seconds. You can decrease the delay to as little as 0.1 seconds
or increase it to as much as 25.5 seconds. To do this, follow these
steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. 
. To change the delay, enter the command *program 89 <new delay in seconds>*. For example, if you want the delay to be 20
seconds instead of 15 seconds, enter *program 89 20*. +
. Clear the password using the command *clearpassword* or *cp*. +


=== 505 Changing Remote Shutdown Settings (Parameters 82-84 and 85-87) +

==== Pin 7 Shutdown 

The Remote Shutdown available on pin 7 lets you shut down the
Fortress' output power through a remote switch. The switch must have
a set of contacts that can short pin 7 on the UPS communication port
to pin 4 (common). (Use a shielded, single twisted pair cable to
connect your switch to these pins.) The connection will shut down the
UPS' output power to the protected equipment. When this happens, the
UPS will sound alarm "Sd" for "shutdown" (Morse code alarm H). When
you are ready to restart the UPS, the shutdown switch must remove the
connection to pin 7 on the UPS communication port. Then, you can
press the ( | ) button to restart the UPS. +

You can change the way this feature operates by using parameters 85,
86, and 87. +

Parameter 85 determines whether this shutdown works with a normally
open or normally closed switch. When you receive the Fortress, it is
programmed to expect a normally open switch, and the Fortress shuts
down when the switch input is shorted to pin 4. You can change the
Fortress to work with a normally closed switch. To do this, you must
change the setting of parameter 85 from 0)Neg to 1)Pos. Follow these
steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. +
. Change the parameter setting using the command *program 85 1*. +
. Clear the password using the command *clearpassword* or *cp*. 

Parameter 86 determines
how long the shutdown signal should be. In some environments with a
lot of electrical noise, the noise could mimic the shutdown signal
and cause a Fortress shutdown. To avoid this problem, you can
increase the amount of time that the signal must be present before
Fortress recognizes it. When you receive your Fortress, this
parameter is set to 0.2 seconds, By changing the parameter value, you
can decrease the required signal length to 0.1 seconds or increase it
to as much as 25.5 seconds. To change the value, follow these
steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639.*
. Change the parameter setting using the command *program 86
<new value in seconds>*. For example, if you want to change
the parameter value to 2 seconds, you would use the command
*program 86 2*. +
. Clear the password using the command *clearpassword* or
*cp*. +


After the Fortress recognizes a shutdown signal, parameter 87
determines how long the Fortress will wait before shutting down. When
you receive your Fortress, this parameter is set to 0.1 seconds. By
changing the parameter value, you can increase the delay to as much
as 2000 seconds (33 minutes). Follow these steps: +

. Enter the Service password using the command *password 2639*. +
. Change the parameter value using the command *program 87 <new delay in seconds>*. For example, if you want the Fortress to delay 3 seconds, use the command *program 87 3*. +
. Clear the password using the command *clearpassword* or *cp*. +


==== Pin 1 Shutdown +

If your Fortress is set to Extended Signal communication mode
(see Section 200), remote shutdown is also available on pin 1. If the
UPS is using battery power, a +12-volt signal applied to the pin for
5 seconds will shut down the UPS 30 seconds later. The UPS willl
automatically restart when the power outage ends (unless you have
changed parameter 39). +

You can change the way this feature operates by using parameters 82,
83, and 84. +

Parameter 82 determines the type of signal on pin 1 that will start a
Fortress shutdown. When you receive the Fortress, this is programmed
to 0)Neg, which means ground or a -12V input causes the shutdown. If
you change the parameter to 1)Pos, a +12V input shuts down the UPS.

.Note:
[NOTE]
==================
+12V is available on pin 8 of the Fortress' port. +
==================

. Enter the Service password using the command *password
2639*. +
. Change the parameter value using the command *program 82
1*. +
. Clear the password using the command *clearpassword* or
*cp*. +
