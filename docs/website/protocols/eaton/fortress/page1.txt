== Communicating with Fortress Using the RS232 Port 



This FTS explains how to
communicate with standalone LI 520, 720, 1020, and 1420 Fortress
models using the DB9S communication port. (This FTS is *not *for
rackmount models.) This document provides information for all
Fortress software versions through 1.00. +



Fortress includes a free
CheckUPS&reg; II Suite software package for power
monitoring and for automatic shutdown during long power outages. If
you are planning to use this software, see the instructions and the
online manual you received with the CheckUPS II CD. +
This document begins with a list of ways you can use the RS232 port.
It then describes how to set up full-duplex RS232 communication
between your computer and Fortress so you can send commands and
receive messages from the UPS. This document also explains how to use
the commands and Fortress' parameters to control Fortress operation
or to display information about the Fortress and power
conditions. +
